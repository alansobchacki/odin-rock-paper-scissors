Project #3: Rock Paper Scissors
=============

A game of Rock Paper Scissors built with JavaScript.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-rock-paper-scissors/)


Disclaimer

This was my first Javascript project, as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and to contribute to the open-source community so that other students can learn from the same project stages.

Also, as directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on the requirements of the project.


About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) curriculum. It is the third project required for completion of the Foundations Course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Create a new function named `getComputerChoice`
- [x] Write the code so that `getComputerChoice` will randomly `return` one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.
- [x] Create a new function named `getHumanChoice`.
- [x] Write the code so that `getHumanChoice` will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.
- [x] Create two new variables named `humanScore` and `computerScore` in the global scope.
- [x] Initialize those variables with the value of 0.
- [x] Create a new function named `playRound`.
- [x] Define two parameters for `playRound`: `humanChoice` and `computerChoice`.
- [x] Write the code for your playRound function to console.log a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
- [x] Increment the `humanScore` or `computerScore` variable based on the round winner.
- [x] Create a new function named `playGame`.
- [x] Move your `playRound` function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new `playGame` function.
- [x] Play 5 rounds by calling `playRound` 5 times.
- [x] Style it using Flexbox.


What I Learned
-----

In this project, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, including working with variables, operators, data types, conditionals, and functions. I also got familiar with using console.log for debugging.


Notes
-----

I had a real fun time building this project. I even threw in a little easter egg for those bored enough to test the game out ;)
